# ticTacToe
Description:

This is the first proyect I have created, the first piece of code meant to be seen by anyone. It is the closure of the first unit. When I look back I realized how much I have accomplished in only 3 weeks with the program.
As its name indicates it is a simple Tic-Tac-Toc game with a lot of room for improvement, specially in the styling field, but when it comes to functionallity it definately gets the job done.

List of Features:
(MVP)
As a user, I am able to start a new tic tac toe game
As a user, I am able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
As a user, I am be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
As a user, I am not be able to click the same square twice
As a user, I am be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
As a user, I am not able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
As a user, I am able to play the game again without refreshing the page

(Silver)
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
Audio Involved
Fully responsive in mobile devices

Technology:
The proyect was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Key things to point:
-To win the program uses datasets to assign a numerical value to the node, then it uses basic math to look for a possible total and from there it evaluates which player wins or if it was a tie.
-The save in local storage is almost completed but I faced some inconveniences.
